“Cold Call Helper” README
-
Cold Call Helper is a program to help an instructor randomly call on students
in a fair way. The primary use case is for use when no students are
volunteering to answer questions, but it has other uses. It keeps track of
when students have been called on, how many times, and has optional features
to mark students as they answer for needing instructor follow-up or losing
participation points. It can output a summary of participation for the day or
for the entire term.

Cold Call Helper was created for Anthony Hornoff’s Spring 2019 Software
Methodology class (CIS 422). The first class project was to develop this
software, based on a System Requirement Specification (written by the
professor), perform project management over the whole project, and write all
the documentation that a commercial product would need.
-
The Cold Call Helper is written in python3, it requires python3 standard
libraries to run such as tkinter. To run the Cold Call Helper, run it from
terminal itself using python3. If you wish to run it this way, open a
terminal window, navigate to the folder the source code is in, type ‘python3
ColdCallHelper.py’ and press Enter.
-
Aside from Python version 3, there are no dependencies, this program has been
written with only the standard libraries.
-
In the main ColdCall folder is all of the documentation files, there are two
subdirectories, Windows and Mac. Because of a difference in how tsvreader
works, the source code must be different when ran on each OS.
